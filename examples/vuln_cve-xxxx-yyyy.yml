# Sample template file for vulnerability metadata for the attack-replay-modules repository
# required for the assignment of specific modules to a vulnerability
# to be saved in the 'vulns' directory as 'vuln_<name>.yml'
---
cves:
  - CVE-1999-9999
plausibility: # list all plausibility checks that should be conducted -> those will be conducted twice: at the beginning and at the end of a verification
  - name: HOST-AVAILABILITY # list the names of the modules to be used
  - name: SERVICE-AVAILABILITY
  - name: SERVICE-FINGERPRINTING
    parameters: # parameter values in the vuln metadata will override module-level parameter values
      - name: PORT # all existing configuration for the 'PORT' param will be overriden for this module
        value:
          strategy: event_data
          argument: dest_port
    success: # additional success strategies, are being checked before any module-level success criteria
      - strategy: output
        argument: "Fingerprint: Apache 2.4.49"
        conclusion: yes
